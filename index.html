    <h1>Welcome to my HTML Tags Assignment!</h1>
    <h3>Just wanted to say welcome again, but in a smaller font.</h3>

    <p>So far I've enjoyed learning the basics to coding and all the things it gives you the ablilty to create! While I only know the basics at this point, as you can tell with this page, I'm looking forward to seeing what I will be able to do with the knowledge gained over the next 15 weeks.</p>

    <p>This year, my family started a new tradition of gathering in early December and creating Gingerbread Houses together. Below is my finished house. </p>

    <img src="../Kali's Gingerbread House.jpg" alt="Gingerbread House" width="230px" height="300px" style="border-radius: 150px;">
    
    <h3>There were 3 aspects I knew I wanted to include on my house before we got started.</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Flower Boxes in the windows <i>(because gardening conditions can be whatever you want them to be on a gingerbread house!)</i></li>
        <li>Gummy Bears assembling a snowman</li>
        <li>A Gummy Bear placing lights up on a tree outside</li>
    </ol>

    <p>And of course, what is a decorating party without some <b>Party Music</b>?</p>
